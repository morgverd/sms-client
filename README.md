# SMS Client

A remote client library for interfacing with the [SMS-API](https://github.com/morgverd/sms-api).
This is currently in-development.

Eventually it should allow for:
 - Easy websocket connection management
 - Event subscription
 - Proper type reflection for responses etc
 - Sending an SMS message then automatically waiting for its delivery
